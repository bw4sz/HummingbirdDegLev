Recent ecosystem classification defines these forests as evergreen high-mountain forest of the northern Andes (MDMQ-Secretaría de Ambiente 2011) We identified flowering plants in five 0.2-1.2 km transects at three different sites: 1) Yanacocha reserve, 2) Verdecocha reserve and 3) Esperanza Hill. All transects were at a minimum distance of 200 m from each other. Details of coordinates, main habitat and dates of field work at each site are provided in Appendix 1. Our field observations were performed at four habitats, namely: 1) large tracts of mature high- Andean forest that herewith we will call Forest Interior (FI), 2) a diffuse forest border that limits with shrubby vegetation embedded in pastureland that we named Forest Borders with Shrubbery vegetation (FBS), 3) a forest border that abruptly limits with large tract of pastureland that we calc Forest Border with Pastures (FBP), 4) a small isolated 0,49 ha Forest Patch (FP) and small 1 ha patch of forest vegetation recovered from 14-year old fire (FR).\n\n# Read in data\n\n```{r}\n#read in data\ndat<-read.csv(\"InputData/InteractionData_Total.csv\",sep=\";\")\n\n#Only ID on birds\ndat<-dat %>% filter(!Bird %in% c(\"Diglossa sp.\",\"Trochilidae\",\"Eriocnemis sp\"))\n\n#create timestamp\ndat$timestamp<-as.POSIXct(paste(dat$Month,dat$Day,dat$Year,sep=\"/\"),format=\"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n#group interactions by Bird, Plant, Site, and Degredation Level\nsdat<-dat %>% group_by(Bird,Plant.species,Site,DegLev) %>% summarize(Yobs=n(),Days=length(unique(timestamp)))\nsdat$Rate<-round(sdat$Yobs/sdat$Days,2)\n```\n\n#Data Cleaning\n```{r}\n```\n\n#Visualize data\n\n```{r,fig.height=10,fig.width=12}\nggplot(sdat,aes(x=Bird,y=Plant.species,fill=Rate)) + geom_tile() + facet_wrap(DegLev~Site,scales=\"free\",ncol=3) + scale_fill_continuous(low=\"blue\",high=\"red\") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90))\n```\n\n**Figure 1. Interaction networks based on the daily rate of visitation at each site and degredation level (0-4).**\n\n#Potential Questions\n## Does the rate of hummingbird specialization, the proportion of used flowers versus total flowers, change across deforestation levels?\n* This would require randomization tests to calculate specialization and compare them to a null   model based on the _diversity_ of plant partners choosen.\n\n## Does the rate of hummingbird visitation change with degredation levels?\n* This would reduce the dataset to plants that are represented in multiple levels, i.e:\n\n```{r}\nplantsp<-sdat %>% group_by(Plant.species) %>% summarize(n=length(unique(DegLev))) %>% filter(n>1)\nplantsp\n```\n\n##Does the rate of trait-matching change across deforestation levels? \n  *That is, do species in deforested areas use different resources with respect to their bill lengths?\n  + This would require that we have information on bill and corolla lengths. How complete is this list? For all species, regardless of whether they are across mulitple sites.",
